# SignLearn Studio

**SignLearn Studio** is an AI-powered sign language learning platform that helps users learn American Sign Language (ASL) through interactive video tutorials and real-time gesture recognition.

## Features

- üìö **Lessons:** Structured lessons covering ASL alphabets, greetings, daily life, family, colors, emotions, and numbers.
- üé• **Video Tutorials:** Each sign comes with a short, focused video demonstration.
- ü§≥ **Practice Mode:** Practice signs using your webcam. The app uses AI (MediaPipe) to detect your hand pose and provides instant feedback.

- üìä **Progress Tracking:** Visualize your learning journey and see which signs you‚Äôve mastered.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Lesson:** Browse the available lessons and choose one to start.
2. **Watch & Practice:** Watch the video tutorial for each sign, then practice in front of your webcam.
3. **Get Feedback:** The app compares your hand pose to the reference and gives you a similarity score and feedback.
4. **Advance:** When you perform a sign correctly, move to the next one and keep learning!
